Computer Networks Laboratory

This repository contains my Computer Networks lab record, which includes all the experiments performed during the semester. The experiments cover essential networking concepts such as network cables, basic commands, Cisco Packet Tracer simulations, socket programming in Python, Wireshark analysis, error detection and correction, and server analysis using tools like Webalizer. Each experiment demonstrates both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.
